# Uncommon HTML Bug: Hidden Div Never Restored

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where a div element is hidden using JavaScript but never made visible again, potentially causing unexpected behavior.  The solution focuses on resolving this by adding logic for conditionally restoring the div's visibility.

## Bug Description

The JavaScript function `myFunction` successfully hides the div with the ID `myDiv`. However, there's no code to reverse this action and make the div visible under certain conditions or after a delay.  This omission leads to content loss.
